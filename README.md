# Keschet
Keschet rules implemented, from fantasy book series Raven's Shadow (Anthony Ryan)
<br>
I did not read the books, I implemented the game for a friend
<br>
Short overview of rules: http://ashotoforangejuice.com/blog/?p=171
<br>
Some small rule changes can be made in constants.js, as there seem to be different opinions about how the game actually works in some edge case scenarios
<br>
But I did not test too much variations
<br>
For example changing the player count will of course break the game
<br>
<br>
Ar the moment just as a local game to play in your browser on the same device
<br>
I tried to not use any third party libraries and do everything in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript
<br>
<br>
How to use:
Open the index.html with your installed web browser or deliver the files over a web server
